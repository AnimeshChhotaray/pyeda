Python EDA Documentation
========================

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

PyEDA is a Python library for electronic design automation.

In particular, PyEDA focuses on implementing data structures and algorithms for
logic synthesis and verification.

PyEDA is currently for education and experimentation. Python has several tools
(eg Numpy, PyPy) in the ecosystem that are appropriate for industrial-strength
performance, so that is a possible future direction.

.. WARNING::
    This software is very much a work in progress. As long as the major version
    number is "0", the API could change drastically between releases. Use at
    your own risk.
