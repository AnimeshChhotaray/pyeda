Python EDA Documentation
========================

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

Python EDA is a Python library for electronic design automation. It is written
entirely in Python 3.2, and currently has no external dependencies.

In particular, PyEDA focuses on implementing data structures and algorithms for
logic synthesis and verification.

PyEDA is currently for education and experimentation. Python has several tools
(eg Numpy, PyPy) in the ecosystem that are appropriate for industrial-strength
performance, so that is a possible future direction.
